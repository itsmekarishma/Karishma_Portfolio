## Contents

- ## Machine Learning
  - [Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction:](https://github.com/itsmekarishma/itsmekarishma/blob/main/Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb) Train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.
   - [Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction:](https://github.com/itsmekarishma/itsmekarishma/blob/main/Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction.ipynb)A medical insurance cost prediction model that uses a linear regression algorithm to predict the medical insurance charges of a person based on the given data.
  - [Loan_Status_Prediction:](https://github.com/itsmekarishma/itsmekarishma/blob/main/Loan_Status_Prediction.ipynb)A loan status prediction model that uses a svm algorithm to predict whether a person is eligible for a loan or not based on the given data.
  - [House_Price_Prediction:](https://github.com/itsmekarishma/itsmekarishma/blob/main/House_Price_Prediction.ipynb) Predict house price for houses in Boston Housing Da taset using XGBoost regressor.
